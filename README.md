### Simple and Clean

> When you walk away
> 
> You don't hear me say please
> 
> Oh baby, don't go
> 
> Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight
> 
> It's hard to let it go

### Dear Sunshine
>
> The way you glow through my blinds in the morning
>
> It makes me feel like you missed me.
>
> Kissing my forehead to help me out of bed.
>
> Making me rub the sleepy from my eyes.
>
> 
>
> Are you asking me to come out and play?
>
> Are you trusting me to wish away a rainy day?
>
> I look above. The sky is blue.
>
> It's a secret, but I trust you too.
>
>
> If it wasn't for you, I could sleep forever.
>
> But I'm not mad.
>
> 
>
> I want breakfast.
